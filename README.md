## 🔄 **Introduction**

**Aiko** is an AI-powered social media agent designed to autonomously interact and engage across social platforms while maintaining a consistent, customizable personality. Aiko leverages the **Arc** framework to ensure modular, efficient, and scalable interactions. Developed in **Rust** for its performance and reliability, Aiko aims to deliver a seamless and lifelike user experience.

---

## 🌌 **Vision**

The goal of Aiko is to bridge the gap between human-like interaction and automation on social media. By combining advanced personality-driven AI with the robust and scalable **Arc** framework, Aiko can:

- **Engage Authentically**: Mimic genuine human interaction while staying true to a defined personality.
- **Adapt Dynamically**: Respond contextually and evolve with interactions over time.
- **Scale Efficiently**: Handle multiple platforms and interactions concurrently.

---

## 🧑‍💻 **Core Architecture**

Aiko's architecture is designed for modularity, scalability, and efficiency. Built using the **Arc** framework, the core components include:

- **Personality Engine**: Manages traits, styles, and preferences.
- **Engagement Engine**: Handles autonomous posting, replying, and filtering.
- **Memory System**: Stores and retrieves interaction history.
- **Platform Integrations**: Interfaces with social media APIs (e.g., Twitter).
- **Scheduler**: Manages timing, delays, and rate-limiting for natural behavior.

## ✨ **Key Features**

### 👩‍💻 **Personality System**

Aiko's interactions are driven by a customizable personality system:

- **Traits**: Define the agent's core characteristics (e.g., cheerful, thoughtful).
- **Styles**: Configurable writing styles (e.g., poetic, informative).
- **Topics**: Preferred subjects for posts and replies.

### 🧐 **Autonomous Engagement**

Aiko can autonomously:

- **Generate Posts**: Contextually relevant and engaging content.
- **Reply to Mentions**: Intelligent responses to interactions.
- **Filter Engagements**: Prioritize meaningful interactions using smart filters.

### 🧪 **Memory and Context**

- **Persistent Storage**: Maintains conversation history.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Generates replies based on past interactions.
- **Relationship Tracking**: Monitors engagement patterns and user relationships.

### 💻 **Platform Integration**

Supports seamless integration with:

- **Twitter API v2**
- Future support for additional platforms (e.g., Discord, Reddit)
- Built-in rate-limiting and scheduling for natural posting patterns.

## 🚀 **The Arc Framework**

### **Why Arc?**

- **Modular Design**: Enables clean separation of concerns.
- **Scalability**: Handles high concurrency efficiently.
- **Reliability**: Rust's safety guarantees reduce runtime errors.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features and integrations.

### **Core Components**

- **Arc::Core**: Core AI and decision-making logic.
- **Arc::Memory**: Handles persistent data storage.
- **Arc::Scheduler**: Manages task execution and delays.
- **Arc::Integration**: Pluggable API integrations.

## 🛠️ **Implementation**

### **Dependencies**

Add the following to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rig = "*"
twitter-v2 = "*"
tokio = { version = "*", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "*", features = ["derive"] }
anyhow = "*"
```

### **Directory Structure**

```

├── src/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── personality/
│   ├── memory/
│   ├── scheduler/
│   └── integrations/
├── characters/
└── .env
```

## 🌐 **Deployment and Configuration**

### **Environment Setup**

Create a `.env` file:

```env
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=your_key
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_token_secret
CHARACTER_NAME=Aiko
```

### **Run the Agent**

```bash
cargo run
```
